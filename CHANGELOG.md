# MSFS Touch Portal Plugin - MP fork

## 0.5.4-mp (Feb-08-2021)
* Added support for "On Hold" type Touch Portal actions with a configurable repeat time. 
  All current actions which may make sense to repeat (such as for control surfaces or AP adjustments) should now be available in the "On Hold" TP button configuration page.
  The generated documentation now shows which actions can be held.
  - Note that "On Hold" actions do _not_ trigger upon first button press, you need to  configure an "On Pressed" action as well, which is a bit more setup but is more flexible
  in case a single press should do some different action.
* Added support for Touch Portal plugin Settings (in the TP _Settings -> Plug-ins -> MSFSTouchPortalPlugin_ page).
* Added setting to control automatic connection to SimConnect upon TP (or plugin) startup. When disabled, connectin must be made manually via the existing Connect action.
* Fixed issue with re-connecting to SimConnect automatically despite user's Disconnect/Toggle Off action.
* Fixed text values like ATC ID and Aircraft Title not updating properly after the first time. [#42](https://github.com/tlewis17/MSFSTouchPortalPlugin/issues/42)
* Fixed/changed light switch states to only reflect switch status, not the light OR switch being on. [#5](https://github.com/tlewis17/MSFSTouchPortalPlugin/issues/5)
* Fixed that Elevevator Trim Position (degrees) was actually reporting the percentage-open value (percents also added, see below).
* More robust recovery (reconnection) in case of (some) unexpected SimConnect errors.
* Fixed generated documentation to include all TP States per category. It now also includes settings information.
* Less verbose logging by default, with more control via `appsettings.json` file (changes in config reflected w/out restarting the plugin).
* General performance and stability improvements.
* Added new actions:
  - Propeller Pitch Adjust All/1/2/3/4 Incr/Incr Small/Decr/Decr Small/Min/Max/Feather Switch
  - Selected value (knob) increase/decrease (eg. for autopilot settings, same as +/- keys)
  - Held Action Repeat Rate, Increment/Decrement 50ms or choose one of several presets.
* Added new states:
  - Ele/Ail/Rud Trim angles in Percent
  - Cowl Flaps 1-4 Opened Percentage
  - Propeller 1-4 Feather Switch and Feathered State
  - Deice and Pitot Heat switch states for Panel, Structural, Windshield, and Pitot 1-4
  - Current Held Action Repeat Rate (in ms)
