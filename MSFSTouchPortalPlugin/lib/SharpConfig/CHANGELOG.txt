v3.2.9.2-mp (from v3.2.9.1)
* Fixed that ConfigurationReader wasn't setting the Setting.RawValue properly, instead relying on a redundant string to string conversion.
* Added Configuration.AlwaysQuoteStringValues option.
* EnumStringConverter is case insensitive, a little faster, and returns null for a null value string (instead of default(double)).
* Added Section.TryGetSetting() method.
* Section settings accessors don't throw but return null/false instead.
